## Task Details
**************************************************************************************  

The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) of Chollet is an interesting new benchmark for AI research. Details can be found at https://github.com/fchollet/ARC

The assigment is to handcode solutions for any 3 or more AI reasoning tasks defined in the ARC. ARC contains tasks involving small grids of coloured squares as input and transformed output as per some logic / reason. The input and output pattern of a task can be visualized at https://iforcedabot.com/ARC/. The task data (input and output) is available as json files at the github.

As part of the assignment, the task Json files are downloaded from the ARC github and handcoded solutions are written in python as individual python modules to transform the input to ouput as per the perceived logic / reason. 

For testing, The input for the module is path to Json file and output is printed in the console as matrix of numbers, which is nothing but the numerical representation of transformed output from the given input as per the logic obtained from visualization using demo of task at  https://iforcedabot.com/ARC/.

The output has been validated with the correspoding input / output pairs of the given jason data file.
